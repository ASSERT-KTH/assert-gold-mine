# How to run computational experiments?

This document describes the alternatives we have to run experiments on servers.

**Option A: SNIC/Cluster**

Open an account on https://supr.snic.se/, and ask to join an existing project on https://supr.snic.se/project/

Expert in the team for questions: Zimin, Javier Ron, Zhongxing

**Option B: Dedicated server (Down now :( )**

We have a server at PDC. Docker is available.

Expert in the team for questions: Javier and Nicolas

**Option C: WASP cluster**

We can have virtual machines in the WASP cluster operated by Ericsson. 
OpenShift interface
Due to the limited quota, we cannot create new instances now. But we have a fully controlled Kubernetes cluster running on this platform. You are welcome to have a K8s namespace and deploy your Docker containers there.

Expert in the team for questions: Long can give you access to one VM

**Option D: Microsoft Azure**

We can spawn a VM on Azure. The costs are paid on a research grant. Monthly budget for the whole team: 10,000 SEK.

**Option E: SNIC/OpenStack**

Ask Long to access to an OpenStack instance
