## Internships during PhD

It's a very good idea to one or even several internships during your PhD.

- in a company (eg Zimin at Google, Javier at Meta, Andr√© at Microsoft, Aman at Oracle)
- in a lab (eg Ye at PolyU, Kashayar at ETH)

### Paid internships
If you're paid by the company / lab, you take a leave of absence. This decreases your TA duties accordingly (20% TA = 2.4 months internships). See with HR.

## Unpaid internships

If your internship is not paid:
- you can apply for funding eg [here](https://intra.kth.se/en/forskning/extern-forskningsfin/sok-stipendier/utlysning-av-resestipendier-ur-de-allmanna-resestiftelserna-1.1141732)
- you keep your full PhD salary (only for the academic lab case) and you prepare a [URA contract](https://intra.kth.se/en/anstallning/anstallningsvillkor/utlandstjanstgoring-ura-1.864702).
