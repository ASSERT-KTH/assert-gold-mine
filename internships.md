## Internships during PhD

It's a very good idea to one or even several internships during your PhD.

- in a company (eg Zimin at Google, or Javier at Meta)
- in a lab (eg Ye at PoluY, Kashayar at ETH)

If you're paid by the company / lab, you take a leave of absence. This decreases your TA duties accordingly. See with HR.

If you keep your full PhD salary (only for the academic lab case), you prepare a [URA contract](https://intra.kth.se/en/anstallning/anstallningsvillkor/utlandstjanstgoring-ura-1.864702).
